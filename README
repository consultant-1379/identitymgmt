You can run RoleManagement-ui, TargetManagement-ui, UserManagement-ui_2_0 by:
running script auto-run-RM.sh or auto-run-TG.sh or auto-run-UM.sh

if you execute script first time as first (mandatory) argument you should give build or <application_name>
(which is f.e. usermanagement, usermgmtprofile).

It will perform necessary cdt2 package link and cdt2 package install commands and run application with
proxyServer.js (real backend, need to have VPN connection to vApp) on port 8585.

This build command should be used only once after cloning clean repository.
This command used to build and run sub-application.
    - second parameter is port number
    - third parameter could be local or proxy or v5.
Proxy is default, if you enter local, serve will be run on localServer.js (fake backend)

Example:
                 ./auto-run-UM2.sh build 8181
                 ./auto-run-UM2.sh usermanagement 8181

If you want to perform cdt2 commands manually see auto-run-RM.sh or auto-run-TG.sh or auto-run-UM.sh script to see which application r
equire which links and do those commands manually

to run serve go to application folder (f.e. UserManagement-ui_2_0/usermanagement) and execute command (-p -> port number, -m -> server to run) :
for local server: cdt2 serve -p 9000 -m ../localServer.js
for proxy server (using VPN): cdt2 serve -p 9000 -m ../proxyServer.js
for proxyserver (using FFE): cdt2 serve -p 9000 -m ../proxyServerSocksV5.js
