            <ul>
                <li>
                    System roles are roles predefined in the ENM system. There is no possibility to modify system roles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    COM roles allocate specific privileges on nodes supporting ECIM.
                </li>
                <li>
                    COM role alias is a set of COM roles, which groups these roles for easier assignment to user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Custom roles consist of a combination of ENM application privileges and COM roles. Custom roles allows creation of a fine-grained set of application access rights in the form of resource-action pairs.
                </li>
            </ul>
