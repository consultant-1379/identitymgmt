            A Target is a network element, management system, virtual network function manager or network 
            function virtualization orchestrator. A Target Group is a logical grouping of targets.
            Target Groups are then used for granting access to a grouping of network elements, management system, 
            virtual network function manager or network function virtualization orchestrator.
        </p>
        <p>
            Target Group Management application allows the administrator or operator to perform following operations:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Define a Target Group
                </li>
                <li>
                    Delete a Target Group
                </li>
                <li>
                    Update an existing Target Group
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two predefined Target Groups:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    ALL - Target Group containing all targets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    NONE - Target Group containing no targets.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, all users in ENM are assigned roles with predefined Target Group ALL, which means the user has privileges on all targets.
            It is possible to define a target group for a user to allow user to access to a part of ENM network i.e. to only targets in the associated target groups.
